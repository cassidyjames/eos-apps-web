<p>What is energy?  Energy allow us to work and live our lives every day  The energy we use in our homes usually comes from coal or natural gas that has been made into electricity. Energy is used by everything that plugs into an electrical outlet - it gives us light, warms the water in our kitchens and bathrooms, heats and cools our homes.  Why do we need to save energy?  Electricity is scarce and expensive. By only switching on lights and appliances when we need it, we can make "using less" a lifestyle habit and save energy</p>
