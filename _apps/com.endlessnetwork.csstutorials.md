<p>While HTML is about defining the content of a webpage, CSS is about styling a webpage. It means setting colors, fonts, dimensions, margins, positions, of a webpageâ€™s elements. HTML is inert. CSS is fluid. CSS brings a webpage to life, by applying a coat of paint on its static content, and elevates its purpose through color, space, emphasis and motion.</p>
