  - Having a baby is one of the most magical experiences in the world, but it can also be pretty overwhelming if you don't have access to a doctor or if you are a new mother and don't know what to expect. Learn about signs that could be dangerous so you can avoid them, and also about things you should try through your pregnancy to ensure a healthy birth. Whether you are about to have your first child, are about to have your tenth child, or are a midwife that helps other women give birth, you will find relevant information here that can help!
