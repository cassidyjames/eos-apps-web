<p>The Visual Arts Encyclopedia, by the Wiki-Art project, includes the greatest visual artists of all time together with their most famous works of art. The original works of art are in museums, universities, town halls, and other civic buildings around the world, and most are not available for the public to view -- so this app will give you special access!</p>
