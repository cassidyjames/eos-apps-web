<p>Snap4Arduino is a modification of the Snap! visual programming language that lets you seamlessly interact with almost all versions of the Arduino board.</p>
<p>Snap! (formerly BYOB) is an extended reimplementation of Scratch that allows you to Build Your Own Blocksâ„¢. It also features first class heterogeneous lists, first class procedures, and continuations. These added capabilities make it suitable for a serious introduction to computer science for high school or college students. Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocks-based, dynamic, live, concurrent, parallel programming</li>
<li>Almost all Arduino boards supported</li>
<li>Uses standard Firmata firmware</li>
<li>Auto-configurable pinouts and high level hardware abstractions</li>
<li>You can interact with multiple boards at the same time</li>
<li>Desktop-based versions for the three major OSes</li>
<li>Free software licensed under the Affero GPLv3</li>
<li>Transpilation of simple scripts into Arduino sketches</li>
<li>HTTP protocol for remote control and live-streaming of the Snap! stage</li>
<li>Command line version for embedded GNU/Linuxes</li>
<li>Support for the Linino library instead of Firmata in new generation boards like the Tian, Yun or similar</li>
</ul>
