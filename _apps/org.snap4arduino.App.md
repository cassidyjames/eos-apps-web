  - Snap4Arduino is a modification of the Snap! visual programming language that lets you seamlessly interact with almost all versions of the Arduino board.Snap! (formerly BYOB) is an extended reimplementation of Scratch that allows you to Build Your Own Blocks™. It also features first class heterogeneous lists, first class procedures, and continuations. These added capabilities make it suitable for a serious introduction to computer science for high school or college students. Features:Blocks-based, dynamic, live, concurrent, parallel programmingAlmost all Arduino boards supportedUses standard Firmata firmwareAuto-configurable pinouts and high level hardware abstractionsYou can interact with multiple boards at the same timeDesktop-based versions for the three major OSesFree software licensed under the Affero GPLv3Transpilation of simple scripts into Arduino sketchesHTTP protocol for remote control and live-streaming of the Snap! stageCommand line version for embedded GNU/LinuxesSupport for the Linino library instead of Firmata in new generation boards like the Tian, Yun or similar

<p>Snap4Arduino is a modification of the Snap! visual programming language that lets you seamlessly interact with almost all versions of the Arduino board.</p>
<p>Snap! (formerly BYOB) is an extended reimplementation of Scratch that allows you to Build Your Own Blocks™. It also features first class heterogeneous lists, first class procedures, and continuations. These added capabilities make it suitable for a serious introduction to computer science for high school or college students. Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocks-based, dynamic, live, concurrent, parallel programming</li>
<li>Almost all Arduino boards supported</li>
<li>Uses standard Firmata firmware</li>
<li>Auto-configurable pinouts and high level hardware abstractions</li>
<li>You can interact with multiple boards at the same time</li>
<li>Desktop-based versions for the three major OSes</li>
<li>Free software licensed under the Affero GPLv3</li>
<li>Transpilation of simple scripts into Arduino sketches</li>
<li>HTTP protocol for remote control and live-streaming of the Snap! stage</li>
<li>Command line version for embedded GNU/Linuxes</li>
<li>Support for the Linino library instead of Firmata in new generation boards like the Tian, Yun or similar</li>
</ul>
